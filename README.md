# myTkinterApplication
My first application using Tkinter to create GUI (Python)

QNA !!

Q: What is this project for?
A: Nothing much, after learning about being able to create applications and configure GUI to display the functions I have coded, I created this project to see what I can do as a beginner.

Q: How long will you develop this for?
A: Until I know how to use a better GUI customization library or when I get better in general I guess.

Q: Is this for a school project?
A: Not at all, I learnt how to use Tkinter in school but did the entire code by myself.

Q: When did you start this project?
A: Middle of my first semester in my first year, took a break then came back to it when the semester ended.
